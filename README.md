# thingworx-async-tasks
[**Unofficial/Not Supported**] Contains the code of the ThingWorx AsyncTasks Extension built on Extension SDK version 9.4 (not provided here).

**This Extension is provided as-is and without warranty or support. It is not part of the PTC product suite. This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.**

Considering the statement above, in case you have any questions regarding this extension:
- do **not** open PTC Technical Support tickets for this extension (since it is not part of the PTC product suite)

This is an Ant Eclipse (Version: 2023-12 (4.30.0)) project that uses the ThingWorx Eclipse plug-in, available in the support.ptc.com portal under the ThingWorx platform downloads.
## How to use in Eclipse (to extend/fix its functionality)
1. Install the ThingWorx Eclipse plug-in v 9.0.1.202102191527
2. Download the ThingWorx Extension SDK version 9.4. It should be a zip archive file.
3. Import the project: Use the File Menu / Import / Projects from Folder or Archive.
4. After import, right click on the project name in the left hand side of the screen and in the ThingWorx Extension tab setup the path to the zipped Extension SDK file.
5. Execute the ant build task. The project uses a customized version of the ant build script that is generated by the ThingWorx Eclipse plug-in.

This is a CompletableFuture Java wrapper for ThingWorx, which allows executing multiple tasks asynchronously and accessing their result in the same service in a similar style as of JavaScript Promise.

The main use case of this extension is to allow parallel execution of logic (encapsulated as a ThingWorx service) and retrieving the result of the Tasks executed in this manner in the scope of the original service.

The execution time of the ProcessTasks service below = the execution time of the slowest Task supplied to it.


## How to Use in ThingWorx
1. Download the extension from the Releases section.
2. Install the extension in ThingWorx
3. Assign the **AsyncProcessing** ThingShape to any Thing or ThingTemplate. This will expose access to the ThingWorx service **ProcessTasks**.
4. ProcessTasks service requires as input a list of Tasks (1 Task = 1 combination of ThingName, ServiceName and InputParameters): <br>
  4.1 Create an info table (PTC.AT.Input.Datashape) of Tasks, and before Input Parameters of different types. See full example as follows: <br>
  
  ```
let inputParams1 = DataShapes["PTC.AT.InputParameters.Datashape"].CreateValues();
inputParams1.AddRow({
    Name: "name", //STRING
    BaseType: "STRING", //STRING
    Value: "Bud"
});
inputParams1.AddRow({
    Name: "waitingTime", //STRING
    BaseType: "LONG", //STRING
    Value: "5000"
});

let inputParams2 = DataShapes["PTC.AT.InputParameters.Datashape"].CreateValues();
inputParams2.AddRow({
    Name: "name", //STRING
    BaseType: "STRING", //STRING
    Value: "Terence"
});
inputParams2.AddRow({
    Name: "waitingTime", //STRING
    BaseType: "LONG", //STRING
    Value: "3000"
});

let inputParams3 = DataShapes["PTC.AT.InputParameters.Datashape"].CreateValues();
inputParams3.AddRow({
    Name: "a", //STRING
    BaseType: "INTEGER", //STRING
    Value: "9"
});
inputParams3.AddRow({
    Name: "b", //STRING
    BaseType: "INTEGER", //STRING
    Value: "6"
});
inputParams3.AddRow({
    Name: "waitingTime", //STRING
    BaseType: "LONG", //STRING
    Value: "2000"
});

let names = DataShapes["GenericStringList"].CreateValues();
names.AddRow({item: "alessio"});
names.AddRow({item: "amro"});
names.AddRow({item: "roman"});
names.AddRow({ item: "vladimir" });

let inputParams5 = DataShapes["PTC.AT.InputParameters.Datashape"].CreateValues();
inputParams5.AddRow({
  Name: "names", //STRING
  BaseType: "INFOTABLE", //STRING
  ComplexValue: names,
});

let tasks = DataShapes["PTC.AT.Input.Datashape"].CreateValues();
tasks.AddRow({
  Service: "Service1", // STRING
  InputParameters: inputParams1, // INFOTABLE
  ThingName: "AsyncProcessing.Thing", // THINGNAME 
  OutputBaseType: "STRING" //STRING
});
tasks.AddRow({
  Service: "Service2", // STRING
  InputParameters: inputParams3, // INFOTABLE
  ThingName: "AsyncProcessing.Thing", // THINGNAME
  OutputBaseType: "INTEGER" //STRING
});
//Service 3 has by default waiting time of 10000
tasks.AddRow({
  Service: "Service3", // STRING
  ThingName: "AsyncProcessing.Thing", // THINGNAME
  OutputBaseType: "NOTHING", //NOTHING
});
// Service 4 also has by default waiting time of 10000
tasks.AddRow({
  Service: "Service4", // STRING
  ThingName: "AsyncProcessing.Thing", // THINGNAME
  OutputBaseType: "INFOTABLE", //INFOTABLE
});

tasks.AddRow({
  Service: "Service5", // STRING
  InputParameters: inputParams5, // INFOTABLE
  ThingName: "AsyncProcessing.Thing", // THINGNAME
  OutputBaseType: "INFOTABLE", //INFOTABLE
});

```
<br>

  4.2 Execute the tasks by executing XProcessTasks with the info table above as input: <br>

  ```
result = me.XProcessTasks({
  Tasks: tasks /* INFOTABLE {"dataShape":"PTC.AT.Input.Datashape"} */
});
```

<br>

  4.3 Retrieve the result from the info table (PTC.AT.OutputDatashape)
